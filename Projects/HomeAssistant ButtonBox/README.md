This folder contains the **PCB design files** for a custom-built **ButtonBox**, a device that lets you control up to **three electrical outlets** via **HomeAssistant**. The PCBs were designed using **Altium Designer** and manufactured with a **prototyping PCB milling machine**.

## üåü **About the ButtonBox**

The ButtonBox is a smart device featuring:
- **Three Buttons**: Used to toggle or control connected devices.  
- **Three Outlet Plugs**: Each outlet can be individually controlled.  
- **ESP32 and ESPHome Integration**: Allows seamless connection to **HomeAssistant** for automation and control.

Although the code is not included in this repository, the PCB files provided here will allow you to recreate the hardware side of the project.

## üõ†Ô∏è **How It Was Built**

1. **Design Software**:  
   The PCB was designed using **Altium Designer**. 

2. **Prototyping and Manufacturing**:  
   The PCB was fabricated using a **small prototyping PCB milling machine**, which explains the large copper pads on the pcb.

3. **Hardware Components**:  
   - **ESP32**: The core microcontroller for WiFi and control functionality.  
   - **Relays**: To switch the connected outlets on/off.  
   - **Plugs and Buttons**: For physical interaction and connection of devices.  

4. **Smart Home Integration**:  
   - Configured using **ESPHome** to integrate with **HomeAssistant**, enabling remote and automated control.

## üö® **Important Notes**

- The **source code** for the ButtonBox is **not included**, as it is no longer available. However, the hardware design can be adapted to work with similar ESP32-based projects.  
- Ensure proper safety measures when working with high-voltage connections.
