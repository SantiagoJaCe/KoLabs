# 🖐️ **Smart-Hand: Accessible Robotics and Rehabilitation Tool**  
### 🎖️ *3rd Place Winner - Engineering Expo 2022*  

Welcome to the **Smart-Hand** project, an innovative prototype designed to create an **immersive educational experience** for students and an **affordable rehabilitation tool** for patients. This project won **3rd place** in the prestigious **Engineering Expo 2022** hosted by Tecnológico de Monterrey.



## 🌟 **About Smart-Hand**

The **Smart-Hand** prototype bridges the gap between **education** and **rehabilitation** by combining:
1. **Immersive Technology for Students**: Engage high school students in engineering concepts like **electronics**, **mechanics**, and **programming**.
2. **Affordable Rehabilitation Tools**: Provide a cost-effective way to monitor and assist hand movement recovery for patients.  

The system measures **flexion movements** using simple, accessible materials like **graphite on paper** and controls a robotic hand using **ESP32 microcontrollers** and servomotors.



## 📜 **Key Features**

- **Dual Application**: Useful for both **education** (hands-on learning) and **rehabilitation** (monitoring hand movement).  
- **Low-Cost Materials**: Designed to be affordable and made with recyclable and accessible resources.  
- **Wireless Communication**: Uses **ESP-NOW** for seamless data transfer between the glove and robotic hand.  
- **User-Friendly Design**: Modular and flexible for easy customization and redesign.
