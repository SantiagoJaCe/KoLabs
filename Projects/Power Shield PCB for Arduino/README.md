This folder contains the **PCB design files** for an **Arduino shield** that allows the Arduino to drive **two LEDs with high current draw**, while also powering the Arduino itself using an integrated **buck converter**. The project was designed using **Altium Designer**, and the buck converter was developed with the help of the **Texas Instruments WeBench Tool**.

## üåü **Project Overview**

The goal of this project was to create a **versatile Arduino shield** capable of:  
1. **Powering the Arduino UNO** from a high-voltage source (12V).  
2. Providing a stable **5V output** with a **maximum current of 1A** for powering other components.  
3. Acting as a **current source for two high-current LEDs**, while allowing control via Arduino pins.
